# ietf101-project-presentations

This repo is for IETF hackathon participants to upload their hackathon project presentations. The contents of this repo will be used as the source for all project presentations at the end of the hackathon. Presentations will be presented from a shared ChromeBook at the front of the hackathon room.

You must be a [member](https://github.com/orgs/IETF-Hackathon/people) of the [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org to upload a new presentation or update/replace an existing presentation. 
To be added as a member, send your GitHub ID to [Charles Eckel](mailto:eckelcu@cisco.com) at your earliest convenience. DO NOT WAIT until just before hackathon project presentations start or your request may be lost in the chaos.

For more info on the hackathon, including the complete and updated agenda, please see the [Hackathon Wiki](https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ietf/meeting/wiki/101hackathon).
