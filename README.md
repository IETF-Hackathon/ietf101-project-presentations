# ietf101-project-presentations

This repo is for IETF hackathon participants to post their hackathon project presentations. The contents of this repo will be used as the source for all project presentations at the end of the hackathon on Sunday 1400-1500. Presentations will be presented from a shared ChromeBook at the front of the hackathon room.

After the hackathon, the contents of this repo will be copied to the Hackathon page in the [datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/hackathon/meetings) such that they are associated with the IETF 101 meeting materials.

You must be a ["contributor"](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf101-project-presentations/graphs/contributors) to this repo in order to be have write access to upload a new presentation or update/replace an existing presentation. 
To be added as a contributor, send your GitHub ID to Charles Eckel (eckelcu@cisco.com) at your earliest convenience. DO NOT WAIT until just before hackathon project presentations start or your request may be lost in the chaos.

For more info on the hackathon, including the complete and updated agenda, please see the [Hackathon Wiki](https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ietf/meeting/wiki/101hackathon).
